# Chatroom-Application-Using-Socket-Programming
This is a Simple Chatroom created using Socket module in Python.
It consists of two different python scripts- Server.py and Client.py
Execute the server side once to create a server. You can add multiple clients by running the client side in multiple instances. It establishes connections with the clients that connect to it using IPv4 and a Port address.
For the continuous flow of messages uncomment the line "message = '' " and comment the line that accepts the username to create a reader terminal. This reader terminal helps in maintining the flow of messages with keyboard interruptions.
